There are more than 8,400 licenced doctors of chiropractic practicing in Canada who are extensively trained to help you in the prevention, assessment, diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions and will recommend a course of treatment to help relieve pain and improve function without surgery or pharmaceuticals, such as mobilization, soft tissue therapy, exercise, education, modalities (eg. ultrasound or laser) and rehabilitation. Chiropractors are also trained to provide nutritional counseling, as well as recommend injury prevention strategies.
